# Training and Sampling Generative Models

This folder contains configuration files and bash run scripts for training and sampling 
modified EGNN-based diffusion models.

These are based on experiments conducted around july 26 2025 on the Mila cluster. 

These files can be used as inspiration to launch new training or sampling jobs, but should be
modified to match your own environment.
