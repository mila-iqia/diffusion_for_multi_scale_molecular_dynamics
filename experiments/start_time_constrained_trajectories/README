# Start time constrained trajectories


The goal of this experiment is to explore the behavior of the diffusion sampling scheme
when starting from an intermediate starting time t < T. We first noise a data sample
x0 -> xt, insuring that the starting point of the sampling is in distribution. We then
denoise this starting point xt -> x0' and quantify the quality of the samples as a function
of the starting point t.

We conduct this experiment in the SiGe 2x2x2 system, which is small enough to allow quick
prototyping, but large enough to be hard to sample from.
